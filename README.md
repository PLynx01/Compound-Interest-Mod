# Compound Interest Mod

> “Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it … he who doesn’t … pays it.” ― Albert Einstein

This is a simple UnCiv mod adding the new game mechanic - The Compound Interest. It is basically the additional income gained from stockpiled gold. The more you have, the more you receive.

After you research Banking tech, you begin receiving gold from stockpiled gold, at the rate of 1 Gold per 200 stockpiled gold. For example, if you have 2000 stockpiled gold, then you receive additional 10 gold per turn.

With the research of Economics tech, you receive another bonus - now the rate is 2 gold per 200 stockpiled gold.

After entering the Industrial, Modern and the Atomic eras, the compound interest rate grows even higher.

On top of that, there also bonuses that are active during the Golden Age.
